# PCreate

PCreate is a Python package that helps you quickly initialize new Python projects. It sets up a new project directory, creates a virtual environment, and generates a basic `main.py` file.



## Installation

Install PCreate with pip

```bash
  pip install pcreate
```
This will create a new directory named my_new_project, set up a virtual environment inside it, and create a main.py file with a basic template.

### To create

```bash
  pcreate my_new_project
```
